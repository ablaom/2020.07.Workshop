# Key Implemented Features

- **One language** for superior interoperability. Code development
  speed comparable with python, run speeds comparable with C. 
  
- **Automatic tuning.** Automated tuning of hyperparameters, including
  composite models. Tuning viewed as model wrapper for easy
  composition with other meta-algorithms.

- **Registry for model metadata.** Metadata available without loading
  model implementations. Basis of a "task" interface and facilitates
  model composition.
  
- **Task interface.** Automatically match models to specified learning
  tasks, streamlining benchmarking and model selection.
  
- **Flexible API for model composition.** Supervised models and
  transformers can be connected in arbitrary fashion. Networks
  built and tested in stages but exported as stand-alone models.

- **Clean probabilistic API.** Improves support for Bayesian
  statistics and probabilistic graphical models.
  
- **Data container agonsitic.** In-memory and out-of-memory sources supported.

- **Universal adoption of categorical data types.** Enables model
  implementations to properly account for classes seen in training but
  not in evaluation.
