*Machine Learning in Julia*

MLJ, an open-source machine learning toolbox written in Julia, has evolved from an early proof of concept, to a functioning well-featured prototype. Features include: A flexible API for complex model composition, such as stacking; Repository of externally implemented model metadata, for facilitating composite model design, and for matching models to problems through a MLR-like task interface; Systematic tuning and benchmarking of models having possibly nested hyperparameters; Unified interface for handling probabilistic predictors and multivariate targets; Agnostic data containers; Careful
handling of categorical data types. 

In addition to demonstrating some of these features, we discuss relationships with other Julia projects in the data science domain.
